# Python-Teaching
Here is the syllabus of the course:

1. **Introduction**
    - An overview of programming and the Python language.
    - Getting to know the course topics.
    - Getting to know the tools for writing and running Python code(Jupyter Notebook and integrated development environments(Such as VSCode)).

2. **Python Syntax**
    - Getting familiar with Python's syntax rules, including how to write statements, define variables, and use operators.
    - Learn about Python's built-in data types, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

3. **Conditional Statements**
    - Explore Python's indentation-based block structure and understand its significance.
    - Explore logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) and their role in decision-making.
    - Understand how to create conditional expressions using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
    - Write code that executes different paths based on specific conditions.
    - Getting Familiar with `pass` keyword.

4. **While Loops**
    - Learn how to create loops that repeat as long as a certain condition holds `True`.
    - Understand the `while` loop syntax and its use cases.
    - Practice writing efficient and effective loop constructs.
    - Getting to know the use cases of `continue` and `break` kewords.
    - Getting Familiar with nested loops.

5. **For Loops**
    - Explore Python's `for` loop, which iterates over a sequence (such as a list or string).
    - Use `range()` to generate sequences of numbers for looping.
    - Apply `break` and `continue` statements within loops.
    - Practice writing `for` and `while` loops in a nested manner.

6. **Strings**
    - Discover string manipulation techniques, including slicing, concatenation, and formatting.
    - Learn about common string methods for searching, replacing, and modifying text.
    - Handle escape characters and raw strings effectively.

7. **Lists**
    - Understand lists as ordered collections of items.
    - Learn to create, modify, and access list elements.
    - Explore list methods for adding, removing, and sorting items.
    - Traversing list using loops.

8. **Tuples**
    - Compare tuples to lists and understand their immutability.
    - Use tuples for scenarios where data should not change.
    - Learn about tuple packing and unpacking.

9. **Sets**
    - Explore sets as unordered collections of unique elements.
    - Learn about set operations (union, intersection, difference).
    - Understand when to use sets for efficient data handling.
    - Learn about immutable version of sets(frozenset).

10. **Dictionaries**
    - Master dictionaries, which store key-value pairs.
    - Create, access, and modify dictionary entries.
    - Use dictionary methods for common tasks.
    - Seeing some of the real world usages of dictionaries.

11. **Methods**
    - Dive into defining and using functions in Python.
    - Understand function parameters, return values, and scope.
    - Learn about using asterisk before parameter name.
    - Explore built-in functions and user-defined functions.
    - Using functions from famous libraries to get familiar with reading documentations.

12. **Lambda Functions**
    - Learn about anonymous functions (lambda functions).
    - Understand their concise syntax and use cases.
    - Apply lambda functions for simple transformations.
    - Getting familiar with `map`, `filter` and `zip` functions.

13. **Working with Files**
    - Read and write files using Python.
    - Explore file modes, context managers, and file handling best practices.
    - Learn to work with text files and binary files.
    - Getting to know `pickle` module.

14. **Exception Handling**
    - Understand how to handle exceptions (errors) gracefully.
    - Use `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.
    - Learn about common exceptions and how to raise custom exceptions.

15. **Regular Expressions**
    - Dive into pattern matching using regular expressions.
    - Learn about metacharacters, quantifiers, and character classes.
    - Apply regex for text validation and manipulation.

16. **Built-in Modules**
    - Explore Python's extensive standard library.
    - Learn about modules like `math`, `datetime`, `os` and `random`.
    - Understand how to import and use external modules.

17. **Classes and Objects**
    - Introduce object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
    - Define classes, create objects, and use attributes and methods.

18. **Inheritance**
    - Explore class inheritance and subclassing.
    - Learn how to create hierarchies of related classes.
    - Understand method overriding and superclasses.
